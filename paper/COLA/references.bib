The original proof, announced in 1998 and published in 2006, is long and complex. The process of revision and review did not end with the publication of the proof. This article summarizes the current status of a long-term initiative to reorganize the original proof into a more transparent form and to provide a greater level of certification of the correctness of the computer code and other details of the proof. A final part of this article lists errata in the original proof of the Kepler conjecture.",

Coq's capabilities are used to implement modal logics in a minimalistic manner, which is nevertheless sufficient for the formalization of significant, non-trivial modal logic proofs. The elegance, flexibility and convenience of this approach, from a user perspective, are illustrated here with the successful formalization of G{\"o}del's ontological argument.",

abstract = {The 150 year old Four Colour Theorem is the first famous result with a proof that requires large computer calculations. Such proofs are still controversial: It is thought that computer programs cannot be reviewed with mathematical rigor.To overturn this belief, we have created a fully computer-checked proof of the Four Colour Theorem. Using the Coq proof assistant, we wrote an extended program that specifies both the calculations and their mathematical justification. Only the interface of the program --- the statement of the theorem --- needs to be reviewed. The rest (99.8%) is self-checking: Coq verifies that it strictly follows the rules of logic. Thus, our proof is more rigorous than a traditional one.Our effort turned out to be more than just an exercise in verification; having to definine rigorously all key concepts provided new mathematical insight into the concept of planarity. Planarity has topological and combinatorial characterizations, which are often confused in arguments that are both pictorially appealing and logically incomplete. The rigor of our computer proof imposed a strict separation between the two.We developed a purely combinatorial theory of planarity based on a symmetrical presentation of hypermaps, which greatly simplified the proof. The theory supplies an elegant analogue of the Jordan Curve property, which allowed us to prove the Theorem under minimal topological assumptions, without appealing to Jordan Curve theorem.},

publisher = {Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated},
abstract = {Part I of this book is a practical introduction to working with the Isabelle proof assistant. It teaches you how to write functional programs and inductive definitions and how to prove properties about them in Isabelles structured proof language. Part II is an introduction to the semantics of imperative languages with an emphasis on applications like compilers and program analysers. The distinguishing feature is that all the mathematics has been formalised in Isabelle and much of it is executable. Part I focusses on the details of proofs in Isabelle; Part II can be read even without familiarity with Isabelles proof language, all proofs are described in detail but informally. The book teaches the reader the art of precise logical reasoning and the practical use of a proof assistant as a surgical tool for formal proofs about computer science artefacts. In this sense it represents a formal approach to computer science, not just semantics. The Isabelle formalisation, including the proofs and accompanying slides, are freely available online, and the book is suitable for graduate students, advanced undergraduate students, and researchers in theoretical computer science and logic.}

abstract = {The technology of mechanized program verification can play a supporting role in many kinds of research projects in computer science, and related tools for formal proof-checking are seeing increasing adoption in mathematics and engineering. This book provides an introduction to the Coq software for writing and checking mathematical proofs. It takes a practical engineering focus throughout, emphasizing techniques that will help users to build, understand, and maintain large Coq developments and minimize the cost of code change over time. Two topics, rarely discussed elsewhere, are covered in detail: effective dependently typed programming (making productive use of a feature at the heart of the Coq system) and construction of domain-specific proof tactics. Almost every subject covered is also relevant to interactive computer theorem proving in general, not just program verification, demonstrated through examples of verified programs applied in many different sorts of formalizations. The book develops a unique automated proof style and applies it throughout; even experienced Coq users may benefit from reading about basic Coq concepts from this novel perspective. The book also offers a library of tactics, or programs that find proofs, designed for use with examples in the book. Readers will acquire the necessary skills to reimplement these tactics in other settings by the end of the book. All of the code appearing in the book is freely available online.}

abstract = {This work describes an encoding of modal logics using the Coq proof assistant. Our formalization differs from previous attempts by providing a uniform representation of several systems for modal logic using Coq’s rich type structure. We illustrate the usefulness of our library in a formalization of L\"{o}b’s theorem which closely follows a classical proof of this result.},
